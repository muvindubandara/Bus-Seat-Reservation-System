## 🚌 Bus Seat Reservation System
## 
A Smart & Automated Solution for Modern Public Transportation
The Bus Seat Reservation System is a fully-featured desktop application developed using C# (Windows Forms) and Microsoft SQL Server, designed to transform the traditional manual bus ticket booking process into a fast, reliable, and user-friendly digital experience. This system improves passenger convenience while helping bus operators manage routes, schedules, and bookings efficiently through a centralized platform.

🚍 In many transport services, seat booking is still done manually, leading to long queues, double bookings, missing records, and wasted time. This project solves those problems by introducing real-time seat availability, secure authentication, and automated database validation, ensuring a smooth and error-free reservation experience for everyone.
